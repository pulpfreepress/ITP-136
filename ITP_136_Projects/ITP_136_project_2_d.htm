<P><b>Project Name:</b> GUI Controlled Robot Car</P>

<P><b>Objectives:</b></P>
<ul>
  <li>Create a Windows application using components from the System.Windows.Forms namespace</li>
  <li>Understand the .NET event handing process</li>
  <li>Understand the purpose and use of events</li>
  <li>Understand the purpose and use of delegates</li>
  <li>Understand the purpose and use of event handlers</li>
  <li>Write event handler code to process GUI component events</li>
</ul>
<P><strong>Tasks:</strong></P>
<blockquote>
  <p>Create a Windows application using components from the System.Windows.Forms namespace that allows you to control the movements of a Robot Car. You GUI will consist of a window (Form) that contains various components to include Buttons, Textboxes, Labels, and other components as required.</p>
  <p>Write event handlers (special methods that conform to a particular delegate method signature) to respond to GUI component events. </p>
  <p>At a minum include buttons that let you move the robot car around it's console floor in the primary directions: North, South, East, and West. An alternative version of the project is to entirely convert the robot car project completed in project 1 to a GUI-based version, where the robot car's movements are displayed in a GUI window.</p>
