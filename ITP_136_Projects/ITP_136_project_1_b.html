<P><b>Project Name:</b> Robot Car</P>

<P><b>Objectives:</b></P>

<UL>
  <LI>Create a menu-driven C# console application</LI>
  <LI>Create and utilize a user-defined class</LI>
  <LI>Utilize constructors to properly initialize an object's state</LI>
  <LI>Demonstrate your ability to utilize multi-dimensional arrays</LI>
  <LI>Utilize class fields and methods</LI>
  <LI>Demonstrate sound identifier naming conventions.</LI>
  <LI>Demonstrate your ability to solve a complex programming problem</LI>
  <LI>Become familiar with the C# development environment</LI>
</UL>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><b>Task:</b></P>

<P>Write a C# application that controls the movements of a robot car around a 
  floor. The robot car will move about a "floor" represented by a two-dimensional 
  array. The floor array may be of type bool (boolean) or any other type you deem 
  appropriate. The robot car has a paint sprayer attached to its rear fender. As the car 
  moves about the floor it will leave a mark if the sprayer is on 
  but not if the sprayer is off.</P>
<P>Control the robot car with a simple text-based menu. You can make the car turn right, turn left and move forward a number of spaces. Your menu should 
  also allow a user to turn the paint sprayer on or off, print the floor pattern, 
  and exit the application.</P>

<P>Each time you move the car forward print the floor to show the car's progress.</P>
